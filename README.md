# WebProject

Simple garage sale website to sell and purchase items from other people

## What has yet to be implemented 
- Visual redesign of some clunky elements
- Filters on the products grid 
- Product Search 
- Dashboard of seller's products. (When logged in the products page will read 'my products' and will be the sellers current products)

## Run with
FLASK_APP = garage_sale

note: must install dependencies for the server to run

## Dependencies
pip install flask flask-wtf cryptography flask-reuploaded passlib flask-bootstrap email_validator stripe
